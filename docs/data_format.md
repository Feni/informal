Contains a representation of the code that can be used for execution. 
The format would be exposed to the user, so consider it vulnerable. 
On the backend, before execution, it gets annotated with author and owner information for billing and permissions.
Code contains the individual cells of execution. 

Cell
    - Data type: auto, str, int, float, bool, binary? unsigned?
    - Structure types: List, map, set
    - Expression types: function definition, variable reference, function reference, function call, expression, objects?
    - null

Will we have objects?
Are function reference and variable reference the same?
How to differentiate a function call

Inline expressions will use the dereferenced ID of the object, not the raw nameÂ 

Is pattern matching, method overloading and multiple dispatch a good idea or bad?

Is all of this type annotation in the schema useful? 
Why not just put 1 or 1.5 or "hello" in it directly?
It's kind of represented in json already without this additional field.
