<h1>Introduction</h1>
Welcome! AppAssembly is a programming environment to make building web applications fast, simple and fun. 

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
There's no setup or installation required to get started with AppAssembly. 
The AppAssembly programming language is built around the rich graphical environment of the web browser, rather than a command line interface. 
You can use your browser to develop, debug and deploy your applications in a shared, live-coding environment accessible from any device. 

<h1>The Language</h1>
AppAssembly is a visual, declarative programming language built from a few, flexible primitives.

<h2>Declarative </h2>
